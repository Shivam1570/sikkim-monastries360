## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted gold (#B8860B) to evoke the feeling of sacredness.
- Background color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC), a very lightly saturated hue similar to the primary color, for a serene backdrop.
- Accent color: Deep red (#8B0000) for highlighting key elements such as CTAs, contrasting significantly with the background.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif similar to Didot with a high-end feel; Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif appropriate for blocks of text.
- Use detailed, culturally relevant icons depicting Buddhist symbols.
- Employ a clean, minimalist design with ample white space to give each monastery and artifact room to breathe.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and loading animations to maintain user engagement.
